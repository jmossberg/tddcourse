TDD Mosssberg Change Log

Version 1.10
============
- Removed unused program on Lubuntu image to save diskspace
- Compressed size of Lubuntu virtual machine: 
  a)  sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/bigemptyfile bs=4096k
  b)  sudo rm -rf /bigemptyfile
  c)  Power Off virtual machine
  d)  Clone virtual machine

Version 1.09
============
- Add comments to explain cmake commands
- Add error in section 13 about mock objects so that student has to inspect code
- Add error in section 10, method splitLine
- Add code comments to explain stringstream
- Correct usage of "class declaration" and "class definition"
- Various small fixes in course text

Version 1.08
============
- Small fixes in course text
- Download Google Test/Mock documentation to make it available offline

Version 1.07
============
- Comes bundled with VirtualBox 4.3.12 instead of 4.3.14. The reason is that 4.3.14 can cause conflicts with Symantec Endpoint Protection.

Version 1.06
============
- Refactored LineToWordsClass to use stringstream
- Building with CMake instead of using Eclipse built in build system
- Using C++11 features in code
- Comes bundled with VirtualBox 4.3.14

Version 1.05
============
- Added a new method lineFeed to the AbstractFileWriterInterface. Updated tests in WordsrepClassTest which uses the FileWriterMock to reflect this. Also updated the mock. The purpose of this change was to fix a bug in the command line version of wordsrep. The bug was that an extra line was added to the end of the new file created by wordsrep. The line feed used to be included in the writeLine method. I have now put line feed in a separate method. By doing this I can make sure that WordsrepClass uses the lineFeed method correctly by adding expectations to the mock class. I have updated the course material accordingly.

Version 1.04
============
- Added section in the course about test driving dynamic word delimiter. The participant shall write the tests on herself. The reference project has been updated with the new tests if the participant get stuck.
- Added Mailer plugin to Jenkins since this mitigates the Mailer$UserProperty error I got before

Version 1.03
============
- Changed system settings so no notification about software updates are shown to the user
- Set active build configuration of reference project to Debug
- Add misstake in implementation of method getSwichValue in class ArgumentParserClass so that the student has to fix this herself
- Add misstake in implementation of method splitLine in class LineToWordsClass so that the course participant has to fix this herself

Version 1.02
============
- Change git user.name and git user.email to tdd1 instead of my personal e-mail
- Remove version information from localhost/wordpress so I do not have to update this for every change

Version 1.01
============
- Add ASSERT_EQ(2, words.size()); to test CanSplitLineWithTwoWords in LineToWordsClassTest. Some people experience that this test hangs sometimes. Maybe this addition will fix this. On the other hand when the try again it seems to work also without this addition. I made the addition both in course material and in reference project.
- Missing <string> and <vector> in refactored versions of WordsToLineClass.h and WordsToLineClass.cpp
- Made method closeFile() in FileWriterClass.h private instead of public, as it should be according to the abstract interface.
- Updated localhost/wordpress to show Version 1.01
- Set Eclipse CDT default workspace to /home/tdd1/workspace
